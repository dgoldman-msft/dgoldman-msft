I am a 20 year veteran of Microsoft working in the Office 365 Messaging space for large global customers. Once upon a time I was the maintainer of (OAB) Offline Address List and OabInteg.

I’m currently working on a :fire: project called PSFramework. To learn more about this framework you can visit [PSFramework.org](http://psframework.org) or visit this project here on [GitHub](https://github.com/PowershellFrameworkCollective/psframework).
